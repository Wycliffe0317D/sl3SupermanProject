LBYEC4A Final Project of Superman Team
Creation of Laboratory Manual on Image Convolution Kernel

The authors aim to create an extension of the lessons in LBYEC4A on convolution kernels through the creation of a laboratory manual. The following objectives are set:
1. To understand how convolution kernels work
2. To explore different convolution kernels utilized in Image Processing in MATLAB
3. To differentiate the various convolution kernels and make general observations on convolution kernels

The final output of the project consists of three parts: (1) a laboratory manual, (2) a solutions guide, and (3) an interactive lesson proper on image convolution kernels.
